# Data Visualization with Python: Exploring Cascade Mountain
 
#### Ever wondered what the trek up a mountain looks like in numbers and graphs? 

I did, and I'm excited to share this experience with you.

In this project, I delve into my hiking data from Cascade Mountain. I wanted to relive my adventure from a different perspective — through the lens of data — and see if I could unearth any hidden insights.

I've also documented my analysis, so you can watch the full breakdown on YouTube ([Watch the video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wx8SyPEwDIs)). In the video, I'll guide you through my Jupyter Notebook, zooming in on visualizing the location data (Latitude, Longitude, Elevation). Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly were my trusty tools throughout this exploration.
