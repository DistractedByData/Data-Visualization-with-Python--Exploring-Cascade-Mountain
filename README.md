# Data Visualization with Python: Exploring Cascade Mountain
 
In this project, I use Python to create a speed profile of my latest hike on Cascade Mountain in Banff National Park. 
My goal was to visualize changes in my hiking speed relative to different elevations, giving me insight into the relationship between those 2 variables.

This project is also unique in the sense I chose to screenrecord the entire process of my analysis, so that I could later upload it to YouTube (watch the video here: https://youtu.be/qX4FO6PSXNo). I personally have learned a lot from watching YouTube videos, and I find it helpful to see other peoples workflows and processes.
